The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a field that doesn't exist in your Firestore document. This can happen if you're not careful about checking for the existence of fields before trying to read them.  For example, if you have a document with a structure like this:

```
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30
}
```

and you try to access the field `city` like this:

```javascript
const city = doc.data().city;
```

you'll get an error because the `city` field doesn't exist.  This can be especially tricky when dealing with deeply nested data or data that may be missing in some documents but present in others.
