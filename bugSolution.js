To avoid this error, you should always check if a field exists before trying to access it.  Here are a couple of ways to do this:

**1. Optional Chaining (`?.`) and Nullish Coalescing (`||`):**

This is the most concise and modern approach:

```javascript
const city = doc.data().city ?? 'Unknown'; // Use 'Unknown' if city is null or undefined
```

This code uses optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access the `city` field. If the `city` field is not present, `doc.data().city` evaluates to `undefined`. The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) then provides a default value ('Unknown') if `city` is null or undefined.

**2.  Conditional Check:**

This approach is a bit more verbose, but it can be easier to understand for beginners:

```javascript
let city = 'Unknown';
if (doc.data().city) {
  city = doc.data().city;
}
```

This code first sets a default value for `city`. Then, it checks if the `city` field exists before assigning its value to the `city` variable. 

Choose the method that best suits your coding style and project needs. Always prioritize handling potential missing fields to prevent runtime errors and ensure a robust application.
